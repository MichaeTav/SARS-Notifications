# SARS-Notifications-Chrome-Extension
Chrome extension that plays a sound when a new student enters the drop in list.

## How to use
Once SARS Notications is installed pin it to extension bar.

Make sure SARS is open in another tab before turning on and once it is click the extension and hit the power button.

If it turns on the button will turn blue and the icon will show a red dot in the corner indicating that it is on.

NOTES:

Currently a sound only plays if chrome is focused so if you are in another window the notification won't work. However you can browse other tabs in the same chrome window that SARS is opened in

## Install
1. Download zip  file and extract.

2. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) in your browser and make sure developer mode is on.
